Pages define things that are interesting on their own. Functionally, anything you want to have its own page should be defined as a page. If you would want moore than a sentance on a topic, it makes sense for that topic to be a page.

Should pages be defined differently? A unique combination of things does not make up a thing. A thing is defined by more than the sum of its attributes.
